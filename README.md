NOTE: This work is provided AS-IS.

* I will NOT help you develop something from this.
* I will NOT help you incorporate this into your own mod.
* I will NOT help you work out why something isn't working.

Just to emphasise on this, I do NOT wish to babysit for the community any more, I've exhausted myself catering for everyone and I simply cannot do it anymore and enjoy myself at the same time.

My development on this project has ceased, I am releaseing this portion of the project and you can do what you like with it as long as it abides by the CC BY-SA 4.0 license located [HERE](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) i.e give credit for any alterations or code you use.

If you wish you wish for any of the texture assets that were use with the "asset" portion of SM_Zombz or you wish to fork this repository please contact me.
